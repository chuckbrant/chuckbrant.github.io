Welcome to my photo blog! I'm excited to share with you my journey as a new photographer using my Panasonic GX85 camera and a few lenses.  My camera is a  micro four thirds camera which has a  smaller sensor compared to traditional DSLRs so there are some limitations, but it allows for a more compact and lightweight body and much smaller lenses making it ideal for travel.

I wanted to do something creative that ties in with my sailboat, and travel and could be done in the small apartment that we live in.  I felt like photography was part, technical with things like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, and part creative with the importance of good lighting and composition. Part of what makes photography so rewarding to me is the more you learn, the more you can improve your skills and create images that truly capture your vision.
<br>
<br>
As I continue on this photography journey, I look forward to sharing my experiences and images with you through this blog. I hope others can enjoy it and this will be a place I can share some of my challenges and successes I encounter along the way.

Thanks for stopping by.
