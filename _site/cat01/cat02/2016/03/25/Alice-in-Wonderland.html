               				<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then  dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think  about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep  well.</p>

<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had  plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was  going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what  she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she  looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with  cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures  hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as  she passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great  disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear  of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as  she fell past it.</p>

<p>‘Well!’ thought Alice to herself, ‘after such a fall as this, I shall  think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at  home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top  of the house!’ (Which was very likely true.)</p>

<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! ‘I wonder how  many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting  somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four  thousand miles down, I think—’ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several  things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this  was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there  was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)  ‘—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude  or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or  Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p>

<p>Presently she began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the  earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with  their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad  there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the  right word) ‘—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country  is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and  she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy CURTSEYING as you’re falling  through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) ‘And what an  ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to  ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’</p>

<p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began  talking again. ‘Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!’  (Dinah was the cat.) ‘I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at  tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no  mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very  like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice  began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy  sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, ‘Do  bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question,  it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing  off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with  Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon  a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>

<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another  long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and  was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears  and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she  turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging  from the roof.</p>

<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when  Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every  door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to  get out again.</p>
