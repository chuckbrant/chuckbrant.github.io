After 29 hours of traveling we finally made it to our hotel, just in time for the tour group meeting and dinner. Our first authentic Greek meal was inhaled before we crashed in very big hotel bed. 

April 23, hard to believe Ez has been gone three years today. Our lives look so different  now and we miss him every day. But we are thankful for family and friends. Traveling with Barbara and Eric is always a joy. We started off the day by traveling around the second largest city in Greece, Thessaloniki. It was rainy so being inside a big bus was nice. Our tour guide took us to a beautiful Turkish coffee shop, we enjoyed some treats at an herb market and then had a big lunch. The Greeks prefer to eat family style, so dishes were placed in the middle of the table and everyone helps themselves. So far, they have been very accommodating for gluten free. Our tour guide has been helpful with all the translations.

Tonight we are going to have dinner on a pirate ship. :-)
