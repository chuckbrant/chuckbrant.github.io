There is so much to write and so little time. Friday morning we went to Meteora, a cool rock formation that used to be under a lake. It is fascinating and you should definitely Google it. 10 out of 10 recommend it. There are six monasteries and one convent on top, dating back to the 1300’s. The chapel we were allowed to visit is from the 1700’s. They are still inhabited by monks and nuns. Most of the flowers from today’s post came from the convent. So beautiful. 

The Greeks are getting ready to celebrate Easter next weekend. Flowers are blooming and the Easter decorations are everywhere. They really get into it here.

As we were leaving Meteora we passed by huge rocks jutting out of the forest and on one of them were teeny tiny rock climbers. You can zoom in on those pictures and see how massive those rocks are.

We made our way south to the small resort town of Nafpaktos. Very affluent, very scenic and right on the Gulf of Cornith. I could have stayed here for a week. Even the full moon was incredible last night. We walked along the pebble beach and enjoyed the warm weather. Even saw a sailboat. :-)
